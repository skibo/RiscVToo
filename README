RiscVToo
--------

A bare-bones, not well-tested RV32I Risc-V cpu with a small local ROM/RAM
and a simple AXI master interface.  It is packaged for use in Vivado.

The configurable options are the following:

        MEMSIZE (default 16K, max 128K)
                 This is the size of the local ROM/RAM.  This should be
                 power of 2.  The local ROM/RAM is located starting at
                 address 0 (see below).

        ROMSIZE: (default 8K, must be less than MEMSIZE):
                 The first ROMSIZE bytes in the local ROM/RAM are read-only.
                 This protects boot code from being accidentally altered and
                 increases the chance the cpu can be properly soft reset
                 without reprogramming the FPGA.

                 Although ROMSIZE can be any value less than or equal to
                 MEMSIZE, it is optimal if it is a small multiple of a
                 large power of 2.  For example 0x1000, 0xC000, etc.  This
                 makes it simpler for hardware to make address comparisons.

        MEM_INIT_FILE: (default "bootrom.hex")
                 A hex file to initialize the local ROM/RAM.

        HART_ID: (default 00000):
                 This is the hart ID of this cpu.  The cpu accesses this by
                 reading the mhartid CSR.

Address lay-out seen by cpu:

0x00000000	+------------+
                |            |
                | local ROM  |
                |            |
ROMSIZE		+------------+
                |            |
                | local RAM  |
                |            |
MEMSIZE		+------------+
                |            |
                +============+  <--- mtime, mtimecmp regs, (0x20000-0x2ffff)
                |            |
                | external   |
                | AXI access |
                |            |
                |            |
                |            |
0xffffffff	+------------+

All reads and writes to the AXI access addresses are converted to single
32-bit word accesses to the AXI master.  Byte enables are supported.

The address range 0x20000-0x2ffff is carved out of AXI space for a
local I/O" module which implements the required mtime and mtimecmp registers.

The cpu does not implement any memory management.  The implementation of the
v1.10 Privileged Architecture is pretty sketchy too.  Only the M (Machine)
privilege level is implemented.

Use at your own risk!
